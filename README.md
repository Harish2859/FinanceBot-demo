HealthSync: Autonomous AI for Rural Wellness

This is a simple demonstration of an Agentic AI system using the [Agno SDK](https://github.com/significant-gravitas/agno), built to support rural and underserved communities with smart health insights and early risk detection.

The agent autonomously monitors health-related data, reasons through symptoms, and generates actionable wellness reports — powered by cloud intelligence and tool-augmented AI models like Google Gemini 2.0 Flash or OpenAI GPT-4o.

What's Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to systems where AI models are equipped with tools, memory, reasoning, and autonomy — allowing them to take actions, perform multi-step thinking, and generate goal-driven outputs.

In this demo, our health agent:

* Thinks (using reasoning tools)
* Acts (using dummy or real vitals data)
* Reports (via structured, markdown-based health summaries)

Features

* Autonomous health report generation based on symptom/vitals input
* Reasoning support to suggest potential causes and next steps
* Configurable for real-time vitals, symptom input, or mobile interfaces
* Markdown-enabled clean outputs
* Gemini or GPT-4o as the core model

Tech Stack

* Python
* Agno SDK for agent orchestration
* Gemini 2.0 Flash / OpenAI GPT-4o
* ReasoningTools, HealthTools (custom or mock)
* .env for API key management

How to Run

1. Clone this repo
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/healthsync-agentic-ai.git](https://github.com/your-username/healthsync-agentic-ai.git)
   cd healthsync-agentic-ai

2. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set your API keys in `.env`
   GEMINI\_API\_KEY=your\_google\_api\_key
   OPENAI\_API\_KEY=your\_openai\_api\_key

4. Run the agent
   python main.py

Output Example

The agent generates a structured health report that may include:

* Symptom analysis
* Risk assessment (e.g., "Mild Dehydration Detected")
* Suggested next steps or medical advice
* Urgency level and local resource suggestions

Ideas for Expansion

* Connect to real health sensors (e.g., pulse, temp, BP via Raspberry Pi)
* Add multi-language support for rural deployment
* Build a web dashboard or mobile health worker app
* Enable multi-agent collaboration (e.g., diagnosis + referral bot)
